Apartment 2 is located in a separate building from the main house and therefore you have more privacy, but unfortunately it lacks a direct view of the sea. It consists of a bedroom with double bed, bathroom, fully equipped kitchen, living room with sofa and large terrace. The covered terrace is filled with table and seating and is perfect for dusk dinner.
